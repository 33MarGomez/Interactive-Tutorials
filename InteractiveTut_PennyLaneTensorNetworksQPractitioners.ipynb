        "To start, when I refer to a traditional matrix, I mean column by row forms you see in a typical Linear Algebra course. These are called Rank 2 Tensors throughout the source literature. Any Rank 1 tensor is a column vector, but PennyLane adopts a row-vector notation specifically because $\\bigl< \\psi |$ is the basis of expanding any quantum state into a density description. For example,\n",

        "\n",
        "This particular example is descriptive of a spin-orbit coupling description, whose eigenvalues would be L + S, where individual spins are in row form. I aim only to rationalize the row-vector form, throughout this document, I call them vectors to make it easier to relate linear algebra concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "A traditional tensor is Rank 4, and I reserve that terminology because it represents how tensors are colloquially described: *matrix of a matrix.* This is descriptive of an $n^2$ description such that every element of an n by n matrix is a scalar to matrix n by n. Rank 4 does occur in the tutorial and throughout this document.\n",

        "You ought to skip ahead to section, \"The cost of contracting a network\" where the Einstein summation function is introduced, contextualizing the first sections' index work. Einstein summation just means comparing dimensionality and multiplying the same occuring index in a sum. Briefly, in spacetime, dimensionality doesn't change so we named it after the famous fellow who invented it. What happens is **every time a number is shared by tensors we go down a list and multiply the largest element that fits.**\n",

All that arange does is generate numbers 1-6, and reshape changes it into a matrix of (right to left) number of elements in a column, number of columns ie rows, number of traditional matrices. To reiterate, the first number in arange() is the vector of whose elements are traditional matrices."
