        "\n",
        "Metallic acid-base reactions are often approached capturing $[OH]^{-}$ or $H_2O$ and inducing a dipole across oxygen so steep that $\\delta^{+}$ causes the leftover species to double bond, bridge, or charge-coordinate to the core. A four oxygen species of M(VIII) or M(VII) will cause the metal to introduce at least four times its own concentration in proton. However, if the species is mostly $H_2O$ and a couple of $OH$, it might not be so productive to describe the acidicity of a species outside of maybe buffering capabilities. Identically, a species that confines $Cl^{-}$ from $HCl$ in a chloride is not acting acidically by ridding solution of a conjugate base. That proton never meets the chloride again.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common sense chemistry principles are relevant in these discussions. You need to think if what happened has consequences. In our chloride example, a single current might reset the equilibrium but AgCl precipitation will prescribe $NaOH$ in the exact concentration of the initial chloride to surely neutralize the solution. By this very same means, $H_{2}$ is proton we never get back, the most obvious metallic basicity that can exist is by resetting the $H^{-}$ equilibrium and closing it with respect to $\\Psi_{cov}$ elsewhere. In removal of the conjugate base of an acid like $[SO_4]^{2-}$ in a sulfate, the reason the proton entered solution was because of the sulfur's oxidation state promoting the lone pair trading that leads to a powerful $\\delta^{-}$ on oxygen. In arresting the redox ability, the entire means by which sulfate is acidic is removed, and though it might not reassociate with its proton, the complex may be considered basic. These arguments are more obvious in consideration of $SO_2$ evolution, $CO_2 / HCO_3$ equilibria, or the displacement of less relevant equilibrium $2H_2SO_4 ⇌ [H_3O]^{+} + [HS_2O_7]^{-}$ in pure sulfuric acid.\n",
        "\n",
        "In some intermediate acidities, the $\\delta^{+}$ induced on the oxygen might not be sustainable without $\\mu-O$ or $\\mu-OH$ bridging modes to another metal. In such a case, the metal removes one to two times its concentration in base, and this can adequetely be considered a significant acid-base outcome. This becomes more true, obviously, if a large counterion is added to sustain a crystallization. It would be nonsense to say that the steric hinderance or counterion charge is acidic or basic, we would point to the metal trapping $OH^{-}$ in an ionic lattice as the culprit."

The lack of any stability to a high-spin $d^5$ might make the $d^6$ milestone temptingly useful, but to spontaneously go from $d^4$ to $d^6$ requires a two electron transition, starting with a forbidden $e_g$ promotion and spin-flip.\n",
        "\n",
        "Particularly, Co(III) also dominates in seeking out low or high spin versus Co(II) is of limiting utility. Most Co(III) are low-spin, and the $d^7$ lack of LFSE makes individual geometric arguments of the diverse complexation shapes necessary to calibrating energy on a per-ligand basis and extending those arguments to establish the spectroschemical series. The Fe(II)/Fe(III) system is significantly more useful for metal-centric arguments as a diverse mix of low-spin/high-spin complexes exist between $d^6$ and $d^5$. This is especially true because $d^5$ is locally the highest energy state for a high-spin and $d^6$ the lowest for a low spin. The spectrochemical line in the sand in Fe(III) is $NH_3$ as enamine. To this end, $[Fe(phen)_3]^{3+}$ and $[Fe(bpy)_3]^{3+}$ are low-spin, so even nitrogen hybridization and $\\pi$-acceptance by aromaticity are important considerations. $SCN$ is tetrahedral in Fe(II), but a useful metric is that when high-spin $[Fe(OH_2)_6]^{3+}$ is exposed to $SCN$, it coordinates through nitrogen instead of the weaker field sulfur. Noting which ligand $SCN$ will coordinate with is useful everywhere else in the table as a soft/hard indicator. The act of increasing nuclear charge is enough for $[Co(NH_3)_6]^{3+}$ to be low spin while $[Co(NH_3)_6]^{2+}$ is high spin and this is replicated in the aqua ions. There are prominent examples of Co(II) redox activity at ligands in place of the metal, but these will not be covered here.\n",

A 3+ charge, 5 electron occupancy, and distinct metal-centric transfer bands, it is hard to ignore that $Fe$ looks like a pnictogen here. It forms from the hydrated Fe(III) salt when $[Fe(CN-C)_6]^{4-}$ is added to it, and we come to the stark conclusion that the self-assembly energy is approximately equivalent to that $[CN-N]$ donation in occupancy of banding a $t_{2g}$ down-spin versus $e_g$.

It is more likely that $\\Delta_{oct}$ climbed with the backdonation to create this effect. It is difficult to ignore the limited $\\pi$-backbonding activity of CN so limited by the electronegativity difference versus CO. Therefore, the conclusion is that orbital energies, and overlap, match closely enough to make $d^{6}$ high-spin favourable enough for transfer - matching conclusions that this electronic configuration is pnictogen-like enough to undo the difference between CO and CN in backbonding activity.\n",

        "$[Cr(CN)_6]^{4-}$ is low-spin octahedral $d^4$ matching the oxidation state of $[Cr(CN)_5]^{3-}$. The latter complex exhibits a high-spin transition at $300 K$, representing a gap between trigonal bipyramidal and square pyramidal towards $\\Delta_{oct}$ creating a high-spin complex while the octahedral energy is too steep. Another useful geometric example is $[Mn(CN)_4]^{2-}$ where the tetrahedral energy gap is low enough to create a high spin $d^5$ complex. That complex must be arrived at by photodecomposing $d^3$ complex $[Mn(CN)_6]^{2-}$, giving a good spectroscopic measurement following relaxation upon reduction since the octahedral Mn(III) species is low-spin. Note that the reduction corresponds to an application of Brillouin's theorem, so in using higher momentum species (configuration interaction) to construct the species the promotion is considered non-unique. This is why reduction occurs at the excited state, instead of requiring reduction before promotion whereby a rehybridization occurs and no precedented species exists. Also the electrons are already paired by a C-nucleus instead of requiring a flip about Mn."

The species seems to suggest that where once there were $H_2O$ there is a fully oxidized oxygen double bond. However, if that oxygen can be released by nucleophilic $[N^tBu]^{2-}$ then any predictions made about the system's subsequent evolution better align with acidic outcomes - a nucleophile or Lewis base has been removed from the ability to form product. By that same metric, chlorination by $[CrO_2Cl_2]$ would create a species closer to an acyl chloride, known to have an extremely oxidized carbon capable of forming any desired connectivity. By that metric, we've produced a very good electrophile which would remove a base. Combine this with $[MnO_3Cl]^{-}$ having the same substitution capabilities with redox strength being pH dependent, and it becomes obvious that the metal centre alone cannot describe acid/base outcomes using only its oxidation state.\n",

The classic example is $d^8$ stable square planar trans-$PdCl_2(NH_3)_2$ adding for an octahedral trans product. The product would be cis if the gas-phase molecule added first, but a 5-coordinate geometry rearranges in time for a trans- product. Another reaction is a counter-example between manganate and chlorine gas where disappearance of halogen influences the ionic strength of the solution.

You might notice that the only difference between $t_{1u}$ and $e_{g}$ sets in terms of overlap is symmetry values. $x^2-y^2$ appears like zero overlap on the z-axis combined with trans-related phasing and the $z^2$ combination like exclusionary phasing to all equatorial ligands.

This represents, charge neutrally, two oxidation units from $[NO]^{+}$ to $[NO_2]^{-}$ but this is not $O^{2-}$ adding while $H^{+}$ adds to $[OH]^{-}$ because it requires an immediate double bond formation mediated by a hydrogen charge carrier. That hydrogen charge carrier needs to have p-orbitals to conserve momentum. The more likely case is that $H^{-}$ exists as an ionicity carrier. Double radical O(0+) instead hosts $H^{-}$ cyanido density as it interacts with Fe. That passes to $H^{+}O^{2-}$ to avoid entering the $Fe^{3+}$ state for reduction of $[NO]^{-}$, which is the otherwise more plausible 1-charge unit change. That change doesn't happen because the higher $\\Delta_{oct}$ would cause us to detect it in the product instead. $O^{-+}H^{-}$ exists temporarily as ionicity is passed into $O^{2-}+2H^{+}$. This is mediated by four cyanides creating equatorial double occupancy in $e_{g}$, three $CN^{-}$ pairs are left irreducible by $t_{1u}$ with the existing $t_{2g}$ Fe low-spin density.

        "The recent 2025 Nobel prize in chemistry suggests intelligent ligand/metal enthalpies can create emergent structures for selective capture. Such chemistry is not without precedent - zeolites are a popular example. In the world of inorganic chemistry, the $\\alpha$-Keggin ions stand out as arriving in solution with the confinement of of important building blocks. Most importantly, they (i). reduce without changes in geometry (ii). only coordinate tetrahedrally situated atoms. A combination of bond strain, hybridization, and oxidative stress can force its building blocks to be ready to react in controlled manners.\n",

        "In all previous discussions, $[IO_4]^{-}$ has seemed like the most acidic of a group of self-assembling species, but its range has not been strictly explored. Here it is reducing $Mn^{2+}$, a similarly pH-dependent oxidation potential, into Mn(VII). In this process, it loses the capability to participate in the iodate equilibrium, illustrating that the self-assembly can be used to quantify orbital energies, particularly as $[MnO_4]^{-}$ is a totally stripped core.\n",
