        "It may not have come as a surprise last lesson that low-oxidation state metals have energetics resembling S, or P, and their oxidized analogues, based on the principal quantum number - 3p vs 3d. Not confined to a consequence of GGA / Ligand Field theory - these are still nuclei within twice the charge of these heteroatoms. d-orbitals also tunnel very effectively, and this is seen in the erratic $\\Delta_{oct}$ down the first groups of the first row. Overall, these are still nuclei, and Zn is nearly twice the atomic number of P.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we think of what it might mean to be good at accepting fluorine, we might be inclined to discuss a similar redox potential, hardness, and complementary charge. However, as seen in our previous lesson, we still must consider $F^{-}$ a $\\pi$-donor. When thinking about $BrF_3$, you might be surprised to learn of its T-shape in keeping with the *VSEPR* model, not an MO-hybridization model verification for trigonal bipyramidal. Some element of equilibrium is necessary, and $IF_5$ actually sinks 9 degrees below the equitorial plane established in the square pyramid scheme. These are evidence that $F^{-}$ alters energetic landscapes to be inequivalent, even with other halogens, who offer similar properties but only with new principal quantum numbers. In these discussions, it is necessary to adopt the convention of non-aqueous autoionizations whereby cationic species are conjugate bases and anionic species conjugate acids.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Ar and Xe based fluorinators involve stabilizing $F^{-}$ about the next principal numbered shell of a noble gas core. These are good checks for adhering to orbital energies according to stoichiometry. It might surprise you to learn that $XeF_{5}$ is made with $NiF_{2}$ catalyst, verifying the effect of displacement from $a_{1g}$ occupancy from $d^8$ and arguing strongly for the energy coalescence created by increasing nuclear charge at Xe (isoelectronic to core potential of third row metals). Cs is the lowest first ionization potential of the whole table, contextualizing how exposed the fluoride ion is. Compounds of type  $[Xe_2F_3]^{+}[MF_6]^{-}$ can be formed from $XeF_2$ combinations with $NbF_5$ as a fluoride acceptor causing the acidic unit to adduct upon donation [1]. Fluoride acceptance by Cr for polymeric species $[XeF]^{+}[CrF_5]^{-}$ reflects a corner share of single bridging target $d^2$. Meanwhile, $[XeF]^{+}[RuF_6]^{-}$ is a single, octahedral $d^3$ compound with an Xe-F bridge off one of its fluorides. Clearly the degree by which the core is oxidized and its charge will reflect the nakedness of the ion - Nb(V) needs to add the acid, Cr(IV) needs to add the metal, Ru(V) can bridge off one the fluorines freely. The compound $[XeF_5]^{+}[V_2F_{11}]^{-}$ reflects the exposure of the ion as a bridged mode made by the more reactive $XeF_6$.\n",
        "\n",
        "More nunaced comparisons exist between $SbF_5$ and $AsF_5$, a comparison between a semi-metal and a metal. $XeF_4$ is less reactive and forms $[XeF_3]^{+}[Sb_2F_{11}]^{-}$ while As only reacts with $XeF_2$. Though the fluorination strength has not changed, that Sb is a better acceptor has started to modify the energetics. $[XeF_5]^{+}[Sb_2F_{11}]^{-}$, analagous to the $NbF_5 + XeF_6$ product, forms at a lower fluorinator and oxidization strength. To match the As acceptor strength requires Au(II) in formation of $[(F_3As)AuXe][Sb_2F_{11}]$, demonstration of the converging s-shell energy. Au is also capable of evolving $[cis-AuXe_2][Sb_2F_{11}]_2$. The trans isomer forms under $Xe$ pressure in the $Au + XeF_2 + HF/SbF_5$ system thus representing a pressure condition. In advancing this discussion, the next strongest fluorinator is $KrF_2$. That compound is capable of forming important targets $d^8$ Ag(III) and low-spin $d^6$ Ni(IV). Their products are $[XeF_5][AgF_4]$ and $[Xe_2F_{11}]_2[NiF_6]$. Note that in the latter case, $[Xe_2F_{11}]$ is formulated as having a weak bridge between $XeF_5$, so strictly the shell acted and the large ion holding the compound together is better considered an intermediate strength compound.\n",

In some cases, it may be the only option to record transfers of pH-dependent and unstable species like $[MnO_4]^{-} + e^{-}$. $[Zn(NH_2)_4]^{2-}$ is analogous to $[Zn(OH)_4]^{2-}$ and is also created by addition of counterbalanced conjugate base additions.

        "There are acid-base arguments involved, particularly where a halogen is redox-neutrally interchanged for another reflecting a core's affinity for the previously shown $\\pi$-donor capabilities. This is the case in pursuit of $[OsCl_6]^{2-}$ interchange in $BrF_3$ as its $t_{2g}$ orbital low-spin $d^4$ occupancy allows leaving group ability and kinetic trans effect transition state ability to consistently create trans isomers. It also shows that the Os(IV) state is approximately in equilibrium with the $BrF_3$ hybridizations.\n",

There is a competing effect whereby all the orbitals are lowered in energy versus the octahedral arrangement, but without occupancy, this could only be supported by the ability to transfer state across the centre.\n",

Once more, a totally oxidized centre exists, evidencing metal-centric descriptions of likely F $\\pi$-donor transfer.\n",
